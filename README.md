# Social-Share-Customizable-Widget
Light framework for customizable social share count widget: Facebook Count, Twitter Count, Google Plus Count

## How it works

The data for each social platform is pulled in as JSON. I used jQuery to traverse the JSON array and obtain the 'Count' for how many times a page had been shared across a given platform. The 'Count' is then injected into a customizable HTML Tag.
